# ERP-Course-Analysis-and-Mining-Project

- This project is my undergraduate `Data Mining` course project, done in 2018.


### Description and Motivation

- The project uses the Students' ERP data from 2013-2018, which consists of their semester grades and courses they were enrolled into
- Most often, students get confused as to what courses(namely `CCC` and `UWE` **)they should get enrolled into, which courses would best gel with their Major background, in what courses they will be able to score the most(higher grades imply that the course would be easy), and they always want to have some insights into what courses have been popular in the past. So, this motivated me to analyse the ERP data and create a system which mines historic data and presents insights which helps students choose courses 
- And not just students, this project is helpful for the administration/planning committe also, as they get to know which are the most popular courses and they can tweak the seating capacity and work on the timetables accordingly in favour of the students

### Aim
- This project aims to help students identify courses(namely CCC and UWE **) they can opt for apart from their compulsory `Major stream` courses, based on factors like ease of scoring good grades in a particular course, familiarity and similarity of domain of these courses with their Major stream courses, their interests, etc
- It aims to help students identify the `Minor degree`, they should opt for, which would be the best for them in terms of complementing their Major and making their profile stronger for a great career ahead with the help of the historic data analysis.
- It helps the administration/planning committe to come up with a better timetable with less number of clashes on the basis of the pattern of courses students got enrolled into and a better seating plan for the same. 

** `CCC`: Core Common Curriculum courses (1.5 credit each),
